Learning to make an idle game using phaser 3

Hey there, my name is Leonardo and I'm a brazilian programming enthusiast.
I have been studying computer engineering for six months or so and I have some practice with some languages,
mainly C/C++ and I am starting to learn some javascript.
With this project I intend to make an idle game, i'm planning for a very big and complex game,
but I do not have that much experience so I'm gonna start small.
Right now the game is not even a real game yet, but I'm working on it.
